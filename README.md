# Solar-System-animation
This project demonstrates a 3D solar system animation using pure HTML and CSS. The planets revolve around the Sun with realistic orbital motion, utilizing CSS keyframes and 3D transforms. The animation showcases interactive planetary orbits with smooth, continuous movement in a 3D space.
Here’s a `README.md` file for your Solar System Animation project. This will help provide an overview of the project on your GitHub repository.

# 3D Solar System Animation

This project demonstrates a 3D Solar System simulation using **Three.js**, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The animation features planets and the Sun, complete with realistic textures and orbital motion. It is designed to provide an interactive and educational experience of our solar system.

---

## Features

- **3D Solar System Simulation**: Visualize the Sun, planets, and their orbits.
- **Realistic Textures**: High-quality textures for planets and the Sun.
- **Orbital Motion**: Planets rotate around the Sun, simulating their orbits.
- **Lighting Effects**: Realistic lighting for the Sun and ambient illumination for planets.
- **Background**: Starry background with a skybox or a large starry sphere.

---

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and layout of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: Styling the web page and positioning the 3D elements.
- **JavaScript (Three.js)**: Used for creating 3D graphics and animations.
- **Textures**: Various textures for planets and the Sun (e.g., 2k images of planets and the Sun).

## Usage

Once the project is opened in a browser, you'll see a 3D solar system with the following features:

- **The Sun** is at the center with a glowing effect.
- **Planets** orbit the Sun in a realistic manner with textures.
- The **camera** is positioned to view the solar system in its entirety.

The planets' orbits are animated, with each planet rotating on its axis and revolving around the Sun.

---

## Customization

You can modify the following:
- **Planet Sizes & Speeds**: Adjust the size and orbit speed by editing the `planetData` array in `script.js`.
- **Textures**: Replace textures in the `textures/` folder for different visual effects.
- **Lighting**: Adjust the intensity or color of the ambient and point lights in `script.js`.
